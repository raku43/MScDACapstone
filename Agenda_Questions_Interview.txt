Program Evaluation Unit Lead:
1) Explain the overall design of the project. 
2) Explain the primary research methodology and the need to do an in-depth interview.
3) Explain the sampling data to be used and how I am planning to use it in the project.
4) Is the census numbers for an age directly proportional to the uptake rate?
5) Is there a hesitancy at a younger age to participate in a bowel screen programme?
6) Is the probability of men and women undergoing colonoscopy the same?
7) The information on the samples is provided in the information leaflet is there any other measure/feature I need to consider for accurate predictions?
8) Are there any research done with regard to the population extension, if yes what are the features considered in the study? 
9) Is the population across different ages in the 2022 census proportional to 2016, is there any analytical study done on the same?
